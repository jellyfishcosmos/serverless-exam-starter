## Instructions to student.

This repository contains the starting code for a lab-based exam on the Distributed Systems module concerning IaC on the AWS platform. 

### Setup

You are required to take the following steps in preparation for this exam:

+ Clone this repository.
+ Import the project into VS Code and run the following commands:
~~~bash
$ npm install
$ npm run schema
~~~
+ Create a new repository in your GitHub account called 'serverlessExam'.
+ In VS Code, type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ git remote remove origin
$ git remote add origin ...URL of your new repository...
$ git push origin master
~~~

### The App.

Deploy the app to your AWS account (cdk deploy).

The app resembles the REST web API you developed in the labs. Two new DynamoDB tables are included:

1. Movie Awards - Stores information about awards won by a movie, e.g. Oscars, Golden Globe, etc
1. Movie Crew - Stores data about the crew associated with a movie, e.g. director, cameras, producer, etc

Examine all aspects of the code related to these tables, e.g. seeding, types, etc. Also, examine the REST API stack code and the lambda functions. __Do not change the code.__

When you have fully understood the app, you may destroy the stack. However, redeploy the app again the day before the exam and leave it deployed.
